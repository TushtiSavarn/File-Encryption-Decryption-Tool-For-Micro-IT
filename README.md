# File-Encryption-Decryption-Tool-For-Micro-IT
🚀 I had the opportunity to intern at Micro Information Technology Services
 as a Software Developer in the domain of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. As part of the internship, I designed and developed a File Encryption/Decryption Tool — a real-world utility app that integrates concepts of cybersecurity, Python development, and user-friendly UI design.

#🔧 Tech Stack:
-Python
-Streamlit for web-based UI
-Cryptography library for AES-based secure encryption
-SHA256 hashing for file integrity verification

#🎯 Key Features:
-Password-based file encryption & decryption
-SHA256 hash generation to verify file integrity
-Bulk file encryption support
-Clean and intuitive Streamlit UI
-Built with user privacy and security in mind

#💡 This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in:
-Real-world application of cryptographic techniques
-Building secure, scalable Python apps
-Designing clean, interactive UIs using Streamlit
-Integrating AI/ML internship concepts into practical software development workflows

👩‍💻 Excited to keep learning and building in the intersection of AI, software development, and cybersecurity!
